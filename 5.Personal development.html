                If there is one thing about Jermane Ramsay, it is that he never gives up. <br>
                I have a success driven mindset and the passion to achieve. <br>
                In other words, I have the mindset of an eagle. <br>
                I know what I want, I have a strong will to achieve my goals in life. <br>
                The desire to grow and be above the average, yes that’s me. <br>
                Staying in my comfort zone will not lead me to glory. <br>
                And so I continue to be open minded, see opportunities that are presented,<br>
                adjust when things go wrong and move in a new direction, <br>
                that’s how I continue to work and develop this area.<br>

                First of all, let me be clear and straight forward. <br>
                SELF-DISCIPLINE IS A MUST! If u want to achieve your goal.  <br>
                I am self-aware and have strong self confidence in my skills and<br>
                level of knowledge. In order to get to where I want to be,<br>
                self-discipline  is the reason I am vision focused and <br>
                achievement-oriented. I have created a clear vision for <br>
                my goals and is taking action to achieve that vision.<br>
                Even if everything is not fully planned, moving forward  with<br>
                 enthusiasm and commitment to be successful is my strong <br>
                 suit against all odds and that’s how I continue developing my strength.

                Commitment to learning: <br>
                I know what I want, and know what is required to reach there. <br>
                Therefore, life long learning is an hobby for me.<br>
                 Gaining knowledge is never enough, so its important to always <br>
                 keep updated with new information through reading and who you <br>
                 associate yourself with, especially  for your area of passionate.<br>

                I highly recommend the book ‘Twelve Pillars’  to anyone who is thirsty <br>
                for success. After reading chapter  4-7 (four of the twelve pillars), <br>
                there are some extremely valuable lessons that will be a book mark for<br>
                my life. Now, below is an explanation of how I can apply the lessons <br>
                learn in my life<br><br>

                <em><b>Achieve Your Goals:</b></em><br>
                First of all, I have always been a goal oriented individual, so the <br>
                importance of setting goals is nothing new to me. If there is something<br>
                you intend to achieve in life, don’t allow it to be just a figment of <br>
                your imagination, but rather, put pen to paper. Goals can be short or <br>
                long term, but either way I have to start off by setting them and all my <br>
                goals are long term right now. But to have short term goals is also<br>
                important, taking it step by step.  Goal setting involves two simple steps:<br> 
                 having a goal then writing that goal down; doing this will trigger the brain<br>
                mental awareness causing it to have a cognitive drive to accomplish your<br>
                goals. In fact, setting goals is not about the goals per se, but what those goals<br> 
                makes of me, what kind of person will i be  when you achieve that goal. <br>
                Another thing to note is this, setting a goal doesn’t mean it can be achieved overnight,<br>
                 so i can’t change my destination overnight but i can change my direction. <br><br>

                 <em><b>The Proper Use of Time</b><em><br>

                Setting goals also means proper use of time, as we all know time is <br>
                the master. “Every day has many opportunities, but only one best <br>
                opportunity.” This is probably my favorite lesson, there are two pains<br> 
                to suffer in life: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret,<br>
                I have certainly chosen the first one. During my life time,<br>
                if I don’t achieve my goals, my regret will not be the things<br>
                I did but the things I didn’t do. And this often happen to <br>
                 people on their death bed. So, unlike some people, <br>
                I will make hay while the sun shines and focus on <br>
                 the bigger picture. If your hands are tied, that doesn’t mean <br>
                you can’t use them. so, the question is, how will you make <br>
                use of the limited movements instead of thinking that you are <br>
                unable to do anything. If I don’t spend time designing my life <br>
                plan, my time will be spent designing someone else life span.<br>
                A few will be masters, many will be servants so pick your side, <br>
                work accordingly and use time wisely. <br><br>

                <b><em>Surround Yourself With the Best People</b><em><br>
                 
Setting goals and making proper use of time also means distancing myself from toxic or non-resourceful <br>
people – whether it may be friends or families. Changing my inner circle or connection with some <br>
people is also a requirement. I know that if I join the easy crowd, there will be no growth, <br>
so I decide to go where the demands to perform are high. The people in my life have an<br>
amazing power to influence my destiny. So, I meditate and ask myself questions like Who <br>
am I around? What effect are they having on me? What have they got me doing or reading? <br>
And especially what do they want me to become? Then the big question, is that okay?<br>
 These are some serious questions because while I am around people who don’t share the<br>
  same interest as me, I still have to socialize a lot - speaking especially about my work <br>
 environment – due to demands of the environment. But still, I am so disciplined and focused <br>
that I am able to withstand the pressure of influence. I will not be consumed by people who <br>
will not help me in the direction I intend to go. <br>

If you become, you can attract. Once I associating myself with successful people, <br>
I will be opened to all sorts of knowledge about the world, business, improving your <br>
relationships and as such I will be opened to a vast new network. <br><br>

<em><b>Be a Life-Long Learner</b><em><br>

“Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune.” <br>
One thing about successful people is that they are always a life-long learner, <br>
and Jermane Ramsay never stop learning. Formal education is to equipped people with<br>
 knowledge to survive in society, real success comes from self-education, <br>
 in other words, learning from life lessons and people around me. Learning is the<br>
  beginning of wealth, health and spirituality. I never stopped reading books, <br>
  and I will always continue to learn from successful people, which is really and <br>
  truly via the internet and I know it’s important to reflect on my experiences to <br>
  remember what I did right and where I went wrong. The majority and most successfully<br>
   people allow reading to be the building block of their growth. And lastly, while I have been <br>
   reading some of the books from the list, I will certainly read the others.<br><br>
