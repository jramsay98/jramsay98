                        my climb up the educational ladder.<br>

                    <a name="p1"><b>Phase 1 - Basic lessons:</b></a> <br> 
                    As a child, during my time at basic school I was heavily impacted by a broken family.<br>
                    Due to my family continuous state of affairs, in my view, <br>
                    I was robbed of proper care and nature by my parents; i had siblings, <br>
                    but I felt more like an outcast knowing that I was the pushed around child.  <br>
                    The lack of proper brought-upsy resulted in me being a troubled child.<br>
                    The lack of proper brought-upsy resulted in me being a troubled child, <br>
                    troubled in the sense that i was often depressed with a high anxiety level.<br>
                    Every child deserve a good education, and even though I was attending  <br>
                    school I certainly was not absorbing anything. <br>
                    My academic performance was poor but i was not incapable of learning, <br>
                    just never had the support From home not to mention the family state of affairs. <br>
                    Moving up to the primary level, i wish my environment was less traumatizing; <br>
                    but situation got worse than before. And please note: <br>
                    all that am talking about right now, I reminisce these days as a young adult.
                    <br>

                    <a name="p2"><b>Phase 2 - primary lessons : The lost child</b> </h3></a><br> 
                        I refer to this phase of my life as being lost because, there was many <br>
                    instances where my  relatives and especially parents showed no concern about <br>
                    my well-being as a child, but instead allowed their conflictual relationship to<br>
                    affect by up-bringing. Even my sister partially experienced the family feud,<br>
                    but unlike me, she weren’t bewildered. And yes, I was bad-mannered but not <br>
                    in the sense that no one could control me but rather I wanted my basic needs<br>
                    as a child to be met; being bounced around by parents who are unwilling to keep you.<br>
                    Like for instance, where ever I go and see other kids with toys, if am not welcome <br>
                    to join a playful moment then I would try and stop the fun by throwing away the toy <br>
                    or any other non-convivial action.<br>
                    I attended  two primary Schools, the Marlie Mount Primary  School  in<br>
                    St. Catherine and Cascade Primary School in (formerly was a Junior High School) <br>
                    in Portland . 
                    I attended  two primary Schools, the Marlie Mount Primary  School  in St. Catherine and <br>
                    Cascade Primary School in (formerly was a Junior High School) in Portland . Did I say <br>
                    portland? Yes that’s right, but you may be asking how did I get there? As stated previously,<br>
                    I was bounced around by parents who were unwilling to keep me due to family state of affairs<br>
                     on both side. So my dad decided to let me stay with his sister and brother with his sister 
                     being my main guardian. Being in a new environment wasn’t so bad to be honest, almost 
                     everyone knows each other and the children were very friendly. Residents are always looking out 
                     for each other, especially children. I was still bad-mannered but not in the same way, knowing 
                     that the environment was different in such way that almost every weekend children were playing and
                      even during the week in the evenings. Playing sports such as cricket, football, pop-gun (which is 
                      played with guns made of small bamboo sticks), racing whether on foot or with bicycles, sightings, 
                      bull in pen, one two three red light and many more. So how was I bad mannered? When ever I was told 
                      not to leave the house, I did just the opposite and reach as far as river with my friends. 
                      People would even say good morning, afternoon or evening to me, and I never replied. 
                      But I over time I  really adapted to the environment.  
                      At school, the environment was not different from in communities and unlike before, 
                      my academic performance started improving because there was one specially teacher who believed in me 
                      and cared for me like her own. Not even to say the school, but my education really began with her. 
                      But there was still one problem, I missed my mother despite all the situations before but dad was trying 
                      to keep me away. Luckily, his sister was so godly and loving that I did get the opportunity to meet my
                    mother again. But I didn’t like doing chores and so always felt like I was being ill-treated.
                    With my bad  behavior when comes on to chores, I wanted to leave and go back to my mother. 
                    After moving on to high school - port antnio high - things didn't change because I was still 
                    displeased about doing so many shores at home and at school I was always in conflict with one
                    particular student. The conflict was so intense that I was expelled from school in my first year and
                    so I was sent back to  st.catherine.  everything was really upsetting for a long while, espeicallly 
                    because I was out of school for almost a year. Being persuaded by his siblings, my dad took him even 
                    though he did want to and believe me I had a new battle to fight. 
                    <br> <br> 

                    <a name="p3"><b>Phase 3 - secondary lessons</b></a> <br> 
                    A teenage boy trying to discover himself. <br> 
                    Being Accepted into Old Harbour High School was a new milestone for me, the first two <br> 
                    years of school was bittersweet. Unlike before, I didn’t get in trouble with teachers<br> 
                     or any other school staff but was sometimes in conflict with students. <br> 
                    Compared to second  form, my behaviour was better and my academic performance was<br> 
                     still improving. In grade eight I was ranked second to last in my class after<br> 
                    getting the first semester results, but with a father who was strict in an abusive way,<br>  
                    after scolding me excessively for my results was certainly a wake-up call. <br> 
                    In the second semester of grade eight I ranked tenth and when I moved on to grade nine,<br> 
                     I came eight in the first semester and third in the second semester. During the first <br> 
                     two years I also engaged in extra curricula activities such as football, cricket, <br> 
                     track and field, volunteering ambassadors, leo club, chess club and a few others. <br> 
                     I mentioned previously that at Cascade Primary school  by education began with one <br> 
                     particular teacher right, well, it was in grade ten when I took my education seriously; <br> 
                     it was at this point in time I started settling down. just trying to discover my <br> 
                     potential so much, I participated in few sports as well as clubs and societies  <br> 
                     during my first two years. I also joined cadet from grade nine. My dad was<br> 
                    abusively strict because he did want his hard earned money to be wasted, but even if<br>  
                    there is something good in that he didn’t support my effort in trying to participate <br> 
                    in extra activities, whether to encourage or show up. Nevertheless, the type of friends<br> 
                     I had influenced me positively and so the motivation to excel was still there.<br> 

                    Amazed by rewards given out to students periodically event encouraged me to do well. <br> 
                    But from grade eight, despite  my circumstances I was enthused about computers. <br> 
                    Information technology was my favorite subject, when it was time to  do select subjects<br>  
                    for (CSEC), I got two subjects free and I.T. was one of them. I never  had a computer <br> 
                    or phone, so utilizing the computers in the library was how I enhance my knowledge.<br> 
                     I was able to master seven subjects which qualified me for six form, I had the <br> 
                     intention to matriculate to six form but didn’t know how it would happen knowing <br> 
                     that my father weren’t willing to support me financially. Eventually, he supported <br> 
                     me financially based on the persuasion of closed friends and relatives. Reaching so<br> 
                      far in my education at the time was never an expectation me, just to think about <br> 
                      the continuous family state of affairs. In six form, while still in cadet,<br> 
                    I decided to join the Schools Challenge Quiz Program and it was really beneficial<br> 
                    after learning so much. But from grade ten, because I was so fascinated about<br> 
                    computers and technology on a whole, surfing the internet and doing lot of <br> 
                    reading was my new hobby. And with my new hobby, I found that the more knowledge <br> 
                    I obtain is the more ideas started flowing through my mind, but I paid no <br> 
                    attention to them until I reach six form. Since then I started writing down <br> 
                    every technological or computer ideas that I imagined,  weird right? After<br> 
                    completing six form I was able to obtain five Caribbbean Advanced Proficiency<br> 
                     Exam(CAPE’s). through all the disdainfulness and struggles, completing high <br> 
                    school with all that I have achieved is something to be proud of. Many times I <br> 
                     felt like giving up on myself and forget about pursuing a good education, <br> 
                    but there was a greater force that kept me going. My next move was to start<br> 
                   university, but had to pause and think about joing the world of work to <br> 
                   accumulate the funds needed for tertiary studies. For the first few months <br> 
                    I tried keeping myself productive by engaging in programs offered by<br> 
                     heartTrust/nta  to get some cash in the packet, even though it was far<br> 
                     from sufficient. During the same months I applied for both JCF and JDF,<br> 
                     and eventually the opportunity to join JDF came first. I seized the opportunity, <br> 
                     but becoming a soldier was never and is still not my goal, and even though I didn’t <br> 
                     know if I would get the time to, I still applied successful and embark on my teritary <br> 
                     journey here at the university of technology.

                So based on the big 5 personality facets, my personality traits are associated with <br>
                three of those facets which includes:<br>

                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                <ol>
                <u>
                <li><a name="personal"><h5>Openness</h5></li></a><br> 
                </u>
                Openness or intellect:
                This facet reflects imagination, creativity, intellectual curiosity, <br> 
                and appreciation of esthetic experiences. Broadly, it relates to the ability <br> 
                and interest in attending to and processing complex stimuli. <br> 
                People that score well on the openness attribute tend to be more receptive to <br> 
                new ideas, experiences, and things. They have an open mind, are curious about <br> 
                new things, and like novelty. They frequently seek out novel experiences, <br> 
                adventures, and artistic undertakings.  They excel in conceptualizing and 
                drawing connections between many notions and ideas. <br> 
                People who are high in openness tend to have many of the following characteristics:  <br>
                
               <ul>
                    <li>Creative</li>
                    <li>Intelligent and knowledgeable</li>
                    <li>Give great attention to mental imagery</li>
                    <li>Interested in new things</li>
                    <li>Enjoys hearing new ideas</li>
                    <li>Likes thinking about abstract concepts</li>
                    <li>Usually more liberal and open to diversity</li>
                    <li>Interested in artistic endeavors</li>
                    <li>Adventurous</li>
                </ul>
                    One other fact is that, openness to experience also tends to be correlated<br> 
                    to another psychological trait which is absorption. Absorption involves<br> 
                    the ability to become immersed   in imagination or fantasy.<br> 
                
                
                <u>
                <li><a name="con"><h5>Conscientiousness:<h5></a></li> <br> 
                </u>
                My personality is definitely in this category. <br> 
                It includes high levels of thoughtfulness, good impulse control, <br> 
                and goal-directed behaviors. This organized and structured approach <br> 
                is often found within people who work in science and even <br> 
                high-retail finance where detail orientation and organization <br> 
                are required as a skill set. A highly conscientious person will <br> 
                regularly plan ahead and analyses their own behavior to see how <br> 
                it affects others.

                <li><a name="neu"><h5>Neuroticism</h5></a></li><br> <br> 
                </u>
                I found that my traits are also associated with neuroticism <br> 
                because many times I tend sadness, moodiness, and emotional instability.<br> 
                Neuroticism is a physical and emotional response to stress and perceived <br> 
                threats in someone’s daily life, in the sense that I distrust many <br> 
                persons who I interact with regularly.<br>

                <b><em>My reflection on the validity of my personality assessment result.</em></b><br>
                I do think this personality assessment tool is useful. <br>
                The questions asked are based on an individual personality trait, <br>
                and each trait are associated with one of the big five personality facets. <br>
                So, answering the questions truthfully will produce a result that is pretty much accurate. <br>
                And in my case, I do think the test has validity because the result is similar to another <br>
                test I have done before. <br>

                From I was a child, my passion was always for computers and technology on a whole.<br>
                My first time around at computer was aty Cascade Primary School; at the time I didn't know<br>
                how to use a computer, so I allowed others to use it and observed. I always do well at <br>
                Information Technology than any other subject in School, and my fascination for computers<br>
                only grows more.
